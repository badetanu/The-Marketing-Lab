Offline sales still dominate in many parts of the region, particularly in markets where in-store shopping experiences are a preferred method for product selection. This channel provides customers the opportunity to physically examine heel rasp tools, ensuring they make informed choices. Retail stores often benefit from brand recognition and a hands-on experience, which is crucial for items like heel rasps, where texture, design, and material quality are significant factors. As consumer preferences for tangible products persist, offline sales continue to maintain a solid foothold in the market. <p>Furthermore, local beauty and wellness salons contribute to offline distribution, where heel rasps are sold as part of foot care kits. Salons often display products in-store, offering a combination of service and retail to customers seeking immediate solutions for foot care.
