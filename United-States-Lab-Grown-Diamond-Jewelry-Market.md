Engagement rings represent one of the largest applications within the market due to the traditional association of diamonds with commitment, love, and marriage. As more consumers embrace sustainable and ethical practices, lab-grown diamonds have gained significant traction in the engagement ring segment.

Furthermore, lab-grown diamonds are often more affordable than natural diamonds, making them an appealing choice for consumers seeking a high-quality product at a more competitive price point. Engagement rings remain a dominant driver in the market, as more couples opt for this ethical and cost-effective choice for their significant life events.
